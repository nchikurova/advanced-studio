# Project Brief

## How are Americans using their stimulus payments?



Data for this project could be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html#phase1) and is taken from [Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/), mostly based on surveys during the pandemic. The new experimental Household Pulse Survey is designed to quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how peopleâ€™s lives have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Data collection for Phase 1 of the Household Pulse Survey began on April 23, 2020, ended on July 21, 2020, and included 12 weekly table releases. Phase 2 of the survey begins on August 19, 2020, and the Census Bureau expects to collect data through October, 2020, releasing data every two weeks. 
While data for Phase 2 will be still collecting, I plan to work on Phase 1. Tables need a lot of cleaning and rearrangments. Data is divided categorically for each table: by state, age group, sex, race, number of household, etc. I will need to group some of the data together in order to make an effective visualization.
